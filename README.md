### About
Back in 2009, I came across a custom console called D4Console which was being passed around various players. It offered various cheats/hacks such as triggering announcer voices, making other players send messages, and an aimbot (amongst many other things).

I have decided to upload this as a curiosity and have included a readme.txt which was contained in the copy I received in 2009. I do not know if this was written by the author or someone else.

The date modified timestamp for the compiled .u file I have is 23:42 31st Dec 2004 which may give an approximate date of creation/initial release.

Several versions are known to exist. I do not know which version this one is.
